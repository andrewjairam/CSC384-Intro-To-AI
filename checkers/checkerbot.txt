notes on the checker bot: ORGANIZED IN TERMS OF PRIORITY

0. rules of checkers: if forced to take, take
2. If you are one square off making a king, always make the king (ONLY ALWAYS IF OPPONENT CANNOT CAPTURE ANYTHING
	- move it toward strong side (closer to large group of pieces/pieces closer to king)
1. look for advantageous trades (setup a double/triple capture, trade piece for king)
	- if we sac for a double capture, sac equal material
3. set up making a king
- Prio making king if there are no pieces in front of a given piece
	- make a king if enemy pieces are behind
	- Move the king towards the middle > enemy strongside (where most pieces are) and look for 	  		reverse capture
	- king best move is ALWAYS loking for reverse capture (?)
- Look for forks(especially reverse taking w/ king)
- look for trades that allow us to make a king
- look for trades that setup a double capture
- Look for trades that trade reg piece for king
- If advantages can be made from trapping, trap
- prioritize taking pieces closer to kinging

- prefer moving towards the opponent 


- In neutral: prioritize moving to defended/safe spots *** when nothign better to do
	- prioritize putting enemy pieces in check w/ safe move
	- safe moves that threaten promotion

"Good" position
- checkers one tile off from kinging
- positions that can get a 2 for 1 trade or 3 for 1 trade
- If we are up material we want to defend more than attack
